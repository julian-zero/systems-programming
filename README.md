Book: The Linux Programming Interface by Michael Kerrisk
Book Link: http://man7.org/tlpi/
The Book is not necassary as I intend to be sufficiently thourough.
However, books are always better at conveying information than any other medium in my opinion.

To Download the source code that the book follows, refer to the file tlpi-downloads.
